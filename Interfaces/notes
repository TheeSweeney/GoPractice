What we know
    every value has a type
    every function the type of its parameters
Which means...
    Every function we ever write has to be rewritten to accomodate different types even if the logic is identical?

    Consider the shuffle funciont we wrote for a deck of cards. Do we need to write a seperate functino if we want to shuffle an int? a slice?a string?
